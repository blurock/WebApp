<b>ChemConnect2016</b> represents the next generation in the organization of chemical data for combustion research.
ChemConnect2016's unique search organization allows the user to traverse
the interconnected network of combustion data. 
The intended audience for this database
are combustion mechanism modelers. This database differs from traditional
combustion databases in establishing a interconnection between combustion data sources allowing 
critical comparison of similar data from different sources. The current database
has taken data from a variety public domain detailed chemical mechanisms (in CHEMKIN format) 
and automatic generation system data.
<br>
An efficient combustion kinetic model, such as a detailed or reduced chemical mechanism, 
consists of hundreds to thousands of individual pieces of kinetic and thermodynamic chemical data. 
A key component in the development of these models is the rapid access and assessment of the 
thermodynamic and kinetic data to be found in the literature. In the design of the models it 
is also essential to study other models and submodels to build upon past experience. 
<br>
An invaluable tool in the development of combustion models is a repository chemical
data needed to design these models where the modeler can assess and choose the chemical information that is needed.
A essential key property of such a repository is the ability to search through the
mulitude of chemical information to find data needed by the modeler.
