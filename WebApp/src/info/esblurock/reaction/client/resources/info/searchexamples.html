			<li> Click the search button (after 'Search Database' to the right, to open up the search field.
			<li> If you want to eliminate the field line (and all lines underneath) click the X.
			<li> To further search an element, click the down arrow (at the right). This uses the current element as the next search
			and places the results at the next sub level. In this way you are following the tree of examples (see video examples)
			<li> If more than five results are given at a level, a 'click for more' shows the next five.

	<li><b>The following are examples of keyword searches</b>
	<ul>
	<li><b>CHEMKINMechanisms</b>
		<ul>
			<li> A list data sets with mechanisms in CHEMKIN format
		</ul>
	<li><b>LLNL</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Information about the data source LLNL
			<li> This includes the data sets from this source ('mechanismSource')
		</ul>
	<li><b>LLNL#H2</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Information about the data source LLNL#H2, this includes the species and reactions
			<li> The data source, 'LLNL', is separated by the specific data set of that source, 'H2', by a '#'
		</ul>
	<li><b>LLNL#H2#oh</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Information about the species 'oh' in the data source 'LLNL#H2'
			<li> The data set, 'LLNL#H2', is separated from the species, 'oh', by a '#'
		</ul>
	<li><b>c2h5oh</b>
		<ul>
			<li> The mechanism species (with a compound name with source info like 'Galway Propene C2H5OH')
			which uses 'c2h5oh' as a label
		</ul>
	<li><b>c2h6o</b>
		<ul>
			<li> The mechanism isomers (with a compound name with source info like 'Galway Propene C2H5OH')
			which have 2 carbons, 6 hydrogens and 1 oxygen 
			<li> Order of the atoms in the isomer label is important, carbons then hydrogens then oxygens 
				(note that, for example, that hydroxyl isomer is written 'ho').
			<li> Some species names could be the same as the isomer name (for example, c2h4).
		</ul>
	<li><b>h2o2=oh+oh</b>
		<ul>
			<li> The lists all the reactions found with 'h2o2' as reactants and two 'oh' as products (or visa-versa).
			<li> Note: The species labels have to be the same in the mechanism (case-insensitive).
			<li> Equivalent searches are:
				<ul>
					<li> 'h2o2=2oh' (the number of species can be given)
					<li> 'oh+oh=h2o2' (reactants and products can be reversed)
					<li> 'oh + oh = h2o2' (spaces can be inserted between the species names - not spaces within species)
				</ul>
		</ul>
	<li><b>ch3+h=ch4</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Similar to the previous example, where methyl and hydrogen form methane.
			<li> Third body information is not given (no M or (m), etc.)
			<li> The ordering of species is not important ('h+ch3=ch4' is equivalent)
		</ul>
