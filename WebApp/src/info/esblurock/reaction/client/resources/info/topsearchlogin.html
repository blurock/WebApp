Registering and logging as a user is done for basically two reasons. 
The first is security, to discourage abuse of the system 
(although I admit even so the system is far from impenetrable). 
The other, more interesting for the user, reason is that the 
searching will be personalized. Currently search terms will 
be cataloged and analyzed to stream-line search results.

<b>Sign in</b>
<br>
After clicking the sign in button (under the title), a window will 
appear where you can sign in or, if you don't have an account, you can register.
<br>
<b>Username and Password</b>
<br>
Enter your username and associated password that you gave when you registered. After you login,
Then more menus will be available to go to, for example the search window.
