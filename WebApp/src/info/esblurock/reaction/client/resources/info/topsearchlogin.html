Registering and logging as a user is done for basically two reasons. 
The first is security, to discourage abuse of the system 
(although I admit even so the system is far from impenetrable). 
The other, more interesting for the user, reason is that the 
searching will be personalized. Currently search terms will 
be cataloged and analyzed to stream-line search results.

<b>Sign in</b>
<br>
After clicking the sign in button (under the title), a window will 
appear where you can sign in or, if you don't have an account, you can register.
<br>
<b>Username and Password</b>
<br>
Enter your username and associated password that you gave when you registered. After you login,
Then more menus will be available to go to, for example the search window.
<br>
<b>Register</b>
Registering is a two stage process. In the first stage you enter a valid email and then a personal username and password
(to be used for login). In the second authorization stage, an email will be sent to the email you
gave and then you must click the link to register and validate your account.
<br>
To register, click the 'Create a new account' button on the right of the signin window and a new window will appear.
<br>
In the new window, you will be asked:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><b>username</b>: This will be the user name to be used to sign in (if the username exists, you will be warned).
<li><b>email</b>: A valid email must be given. This email will be used for the authentification process.
<li><b>password</b> You will be asked for a password (and again to validate) that will used for login.
</ul>
