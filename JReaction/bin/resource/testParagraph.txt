Through automated generation techniques, a single comprehensive combustion mechanism describing the high and low temperature oxidative behavior of nalkanes
butane to hexadecane is presented. In contrast to other systems for automatic generation, the REACTION system uses pathways to organize the
application of reaction classes. This “controlled” generation process not only mimics what is done by hand, but also helps limit the size of the generated
mechanisms. A systematic reaction by reaction and numerical comparison of the LLNL tetradecane mechanism generated by hand and the automatically
generated by REACTION mechanism is presented. The generated mechanism has 2176 species and 7269 (reversible) reactions.
