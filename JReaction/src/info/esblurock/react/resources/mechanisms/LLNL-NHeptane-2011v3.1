FullDescription
This mechanism represents an updated release of the previous version available on the website (Version 3.0).
The mechanism is based on the previously developed and very successful mechanism of Curran et al. 1998 [1].
Version 3.1 fixes some bugs found in Version 3.0. This detailed chemical kinetic mechanism
has been developed and validated by comparison to experiments in shock tubes and rapid compression machines.
Over the series of experiments numerically investigated, the initial pressure ranged from 3 to 50 atm,
the temperature from 650 to 1200 K, and equivalence ratios from 0.3 to 1.0. The mechanism performs well
at both low and high temperature and over a broad pressure range important for internal combustion engines.
